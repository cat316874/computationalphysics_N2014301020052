#Abstract
In this program I plot the motion of a mass point subjected to a central field for several different forms of field and plot the procession of the perihelion of the Mercury.

#Background
##Bertrand's theorem
In classical mechanics, Bertrand's theorem states that among central force potentials with bound orbits, there are only two types of central force potentials with the property that all bound orbits are also closed orbits: an inverse-square central force such as the gravitational or electrostatic potential

and the radial harmonic oscillator potential

The theorem was discovered by and named for the French mathematician Joseph Bertrand.
##Kepler's laws of planetary motion
In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.

+ The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
+ A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
+ The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

We can study their traits of motion using the Euler-Cromer method.
